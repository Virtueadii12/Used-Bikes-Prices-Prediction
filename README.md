# 🚲 Used Bike Price Prediction

## 📌 Objective
This project aims to predict the resale price of used bikes based on features like bike brand, age, kilometers driven, owner count, and more. It helps customers and dealers to estimate a fair price for used bikes using machine learning.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information such as:
- Bike Name / Brand
- Age of the bike (in years)
- Kilometers driven
- Number of owners
- Present price
- Selling price

(Data collected from Kaggle or custom scraped dataset)

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and converted data types.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used graphs and plots to find patterns and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transformed categorical variables using label encoding.
4. **Model Building:** Used Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Calculated R² score, MAE, MSE to measure performance.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved an accuracy (R² score) of around **85%** on the test set using Random Forest.
- Found that **bike age** and **kms driven** are major factors affecting selling price.
